                    <p>You start in prison where the only way out is through a cave system, dug out by the previous prisoners.</p>
                    <p>You start with only the clothes on your back and a small amount of food.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Once you make your escape, venture out in the world and try to survive. Make sure you find a bed and set your spawn,
                    or you'll end up back in prison, if you're killed!!</p>
